      Tata Steel successfully bid for the Jamshedpur franchise in 2017 to have
      its own football club participate in the coveted Indian Super League
      (ISL). The steel giant, which has been a pioneer in the development of
      sports in India, won the bid with Jamshedpur as the host city and
      participated in the ISL by the name Jamshedpur Football Club. The club
      play their home matches at the iconic JRD Tata Sports Complex also fondly
      known as ‘The Furnace’ which has the highest average attendance for the
      ISL matches since the formation of the club (over 20,000). In its first
      two seasons, the club finished 5th on the Hero ISL table, narrowly missing
      out on the semi-finals. The club also reached the quarter-finals of the
      Super Cup in April 2018. In 2019, the club finished 8th under the Spanish
      head coach, Antonio Iriondo. For Season 2020-21, the club made some major
      changes at their helm as they appointed the English manager, Owen Coyle,
      who has led English Premier League clubs like Burnley and Bolton
      Wanderers, MLS Club Houston Dynamo, and Hero ISL club Chennaiyin FC (where
      he took the struggling bottom-placed club to reach the 2019-20 final).
      Witnessing an uptick in the performance as the club finished 6th on the
      Hero ISL table, Jamshedpur FC continued working under the guidance of Owen
      Coyle for the 2021-22 season as well and will now be aiming to break the
      deadlock and qualify for the playoffs. Tata’s commitment to sports in
      India Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata envisaged not only Asia's first fully
      integrated Steel Plant but also the model township of Jamshedpur. He
      advised his son, Sir Dorab Tata, to earmark "areas for Football, Hockey
      and Parks….". Tata Steel's commitment to sports, in fact, preceded the
      building of the township. The aforesaid letter was written in 1902 and the
      site for Jamshedpur selected in 1907. J. R. D. Tata gave fruition to J. N.
      Tata's vision, inculcating sports as an integral part of Tata Steel's
      corporate philosophy. Under JRD Tata’s stewardship Tata Steel introduced
      world class football to India through the famous Super Soccer series. Some
      of the top clubs of Europe and South America played against India’s best.
      Tata Football Academy, in fact, was established while J.R.D. Tata was the
      Company's Chairman and became a reality with his active support. A keen
      and skillful sportsman himself, J.R.D. Tata provided great encouragement
      to all sports disciplines. The academy has many accolades to its credit
      and has produced over 150 players who have gone on to represent the Indian
      national team. Keeping to its commitment to develop sports from the
      ground-up, Tata Steel also hosts the annual community football cup where
      over 25,000 locals participate. The formation of Jamshedpur FC created a
      deeper engagement with the community via various grassroot and youth
      development programmes run by the club across Jamshedpur and across
      Jharkhand with Tata Steel Foundation. With multiple football schools and
      training centers engaging over 3,000 kids, with Football Festivals and
      Tournaments, and also developing over 200 trainers and coaches, Jamshedpur
      FC has made major strides in Indian Football in a very short period of
      time. And the journey continues…
