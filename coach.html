    <h2>About</h1>
    <p>
      Adrian Neil Boothroyd (born 8 February 1971) is an English former
      footballer who is currently the manager of Indian Super League club
      Jamshedpur.[3] At club level, he was manager of Watford from 2005 to 2008.
      During his time with Watford, he was regarded as one of the best young
      managers in England.[4] At the time of his departure, he was the youngest
      and the second longest serving manager in the division. He is known for
      his direct long-ball approach, and is often referred to by fans and the
      media as "Aidy Hoofroyd".[5][6][7][8] Boothroyd then had short spells at
      Colchester United and Coventry City. In 2011, he replaced Gary Johnson at
      Northampton Town. After saving the club from relegation in the 2011–12
      season, he took Northampton to the League Two Playoff final in May 2013,
      only to be defeated in the final. After a poor start to the 2013–14
      season, he was relieved of his duties on 21 December 2013, with the club
      bottom of the Football League.
